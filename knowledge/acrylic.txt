Properties of Acrylic Fiber
Acrylic fibers resist many chemicals, including acids, alkaline solutions, bleaches, and oxidizing agents.

They can take sudden impacts without breaking because they have strong impact resistance.
Acrylic fibers don’t easily absorb moisture due to their hydrophobic nature, but they can hold on to atmospheric moisture.
They are durable, with excellent fatigue resistance that allows them to withstand repeated loads.
Acrylic fibers can handle high temperatures from 160-250°C without melting.
They don’t easily degrade or fade when exposed to sunlight, making them UV resistant.
While they may slowly deform under constant load or stress due to low creep resistance.
Acrylic fibers don’t dissolve in water or most organic solvents.
They are flammable and can melt and drip when exposed to heat, but they self-extinguish when the heat source is removed.
They also resist mildew and other microorganisms.
Acrylic fibers are strong and can endure bending and twisting without breaking. They also have moderate to good abrasion resistance against wear and tear.
By making chemical modifications, acrylic fibers can be customized to enhance specific properties or create different types of acrylic fibers.

Advantages of Acrylic Fiber
It’s lightweight.
It’s impressively durable.
The fabric has exceptional elasticity, quickly returning to its original shape after stretching.
It feels gentle to the touch.
It keeps the wearer warm.
It exhibits remarkable resistance to sunlight and weathering.
It can be washed, depending on the fabric type and finish.

Disadvantages of Acrylic Fiber
It can stretch and shrink easily.
It has moderate strength.
Because it repels moisture, it may cause static electricity and pilling.
It degrades and changes color when exposed to extreme heat.

Use of Acrylic Fiber
Apparel includes sweaters, socks, fleece clothing, circular-knit garments, sportswear, and children’s wear.
Household textiles consist of carpets, blankets, area rugs, upholstery, and pile fabrics.
Outdoor uses involve car tops, boat covers, awnings, and outdoor furniture.
Industrial applications include filtration materials, construction reinforcement, and components for automotive batteries.

Is Acrylic a Sustainable Material?

Yes – acrylic is a highly sustainable material, which comes as a surprise to many. 

Versatile, durable and recyclable, acrylic is key to a range of sustainable solutions. 

It is no secret that plastics have a notoriously bad reputation for their impact on the environment. However, plastics in fact have a very good environmental profile, and are an industry leader in research, development, and innovation. As a group, plastics make a huge contribution to sustainable development through the likes of recyclability and energy-saving and energy-recovering options. 

Where acrylic runs into trouble is the lack of education and facilities surrounding its recycling capabilities. While most users would choose to recycle their waste, the limited availability of knowledge and ethical recycling facilities, prevents them from doing so.

Many recycling companies do not have the facilities to recycle acrylics. As a result of this, acrylic is one of the least recycled types of plastic – leading to its bad reputation.

However, acrylic is highly recyclable. Acrylic can be chipped, melted and extruded into new products. Furthermore, the plastic is infinitely recyclable, meaning it can be recycled without losing its properties.
