What is Angora wool fabric?

Angora wool is a type of wool derived from the coats of Angora rabbits. While this luxurious fiber has come under fire in recent years due to the mistreatment of Angora rabbits, it is entirely possible to produce Angora wool in an ethical, sustainable way that does not involve cruelty to animals.
At 12-16 microns, Angora wool fibers are among the finest types of wool fibers in the world, and as a result, Angora wool is remarkably silky and soft.
