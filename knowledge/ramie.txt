Ramie is otherwise known as China Grass, Grass Linen, Rhea & Grass Cloth.

A warm humid climate is essential for cultivating Ramie, (optimum growing temperature of 25-35Â°C.)

True Ramie or China grass has heart shaped leaves, the underside is white with small dense hairs which do not sting unlike the European stinging nettle. These hairs give the leaves a silvery appearance. 

The process of transforming Ramie fibres into textiles is a similar process of that from flax to linen. The Ramie fibre is very fine, like silk, and naturally white in colour. Ramie is often blended with other natural fibres, like cotton or viscose, this can resemble anything from fine linen to a more coarse scrim.
